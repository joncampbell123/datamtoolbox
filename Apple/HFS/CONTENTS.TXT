Filesystem Name:         Apple Macintosh Hierarchical Filesystem
Filesystem abbreviation: HFS
Filesystem status:       Widely used on all Macintosh media

HFS is considered THE filesystem of the Macintosh OS. It is used
on virtually all Macintosh floppies and hard drives in existience,
with it's only replacement being HFS+ for large hard drives.

HFS allows filenames up to 31 characters long, with data and resource
forks. The directory structure and many basic filesystem structures
are organized in a B* tree, managed by a catalog file. Files are
by default stored non-fragmented on the disk, though provisions
are made using "extents" to allow fragmentation.
