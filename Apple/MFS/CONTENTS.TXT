Content type:            Filesystem
Filesystem Name:         Apple Macintosh Filesystem
Filesystem abbreviation: MFS
Filesystem status:       Old and obsolete

MFS is an old obsolete filesystem that was once used exclusively
by all versions of the Macintosh OS up until somewhere around
3.11 when it was replaced by the now widely known HFS (Hierarchical
File System). It was used so little in the commercial software world
that it is unlikely you will find a floppy disk with an MFS filesystem
on it (the best examples of MFS that I can find are the original
Macintosh System floppies prior to 3.11).

Despite different methods of organizing files, HFS and MFS have a lot
in common. Both allow data and resource forks. The filesystem structures
for MFS and HFS are very similar to each other, in fact many HFS
structures are merely MFS structures with additional data fields.

MFS however does not use B* trees as HFS does. MFS instead uses a
singly linked list of allocation blocks, much like MS-DOS + FAT does
with clusters. Each file is associated with an allocation block that it
starts at (one for each fork), and the file continues until the end of
the chain.

Folders do not exist in MFS. No provisions are made for folders, they
are "faked" by the Finder.


programs provided in this directory are:

./mfsdump.cpp

    utility to read MFS filesystems and dump the files
    contained within. both data and resource forks are
    dumped. files are written to the current directory
    using the filename given in the MFS filesystem
    (with Macintosh extended characters filtered out).
