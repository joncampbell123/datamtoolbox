A C++ class to read and expose items inside several demos by the Future Crew:

(you can find these on www.hornet.org)

Unreal (v1.0 and v1.1)
Panic
Theparty
Fishtro




Each program is distributed as a standalone .EXE with all of
the data and program code packed inside itself. Along with
all of the data, a simple directory structure is inserted as
well (a pointer to it is stored as the last 4 bytes) which
points to everything used in the demo (and then some).
