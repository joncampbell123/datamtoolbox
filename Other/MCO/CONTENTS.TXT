Filesystem Name:         Syntomic Systems MCO filesystem
Filesystem abbreviation: MCO
Filesystem status:       ?

MCO was a very simple timesharing system developed by Syntomic Systems
for a 68000 based computer platform. It came on 5.25" floppies and
utilitized a low-level format of 5 sectors/track, 1024 bytes/sector,
using only one side of the floppy to achieve 400KB of storage. The
filesystem however was built so that it could work on any medium
regardless of sector size. The floppy drive is treated like one big
character device, and the filesystem structures often refer to other
parts of the disk as byte offsets rather than sectors or clusters.

Two versions of the filesystem exist: MCO 1.0 and MCO 2.0. The only
major difference is the location of the root directory and the
size of the filesystem structures.

To my knowledge this OS never really saw the light of day, despite it's
development from 1987 through 1989.
