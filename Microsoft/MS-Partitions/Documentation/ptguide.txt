               ===============================================


     There is room for only four (4) entries in each Partition Table.
  They begin at 01BE, 01CE, 01DE and 01EE and are each 16 bytes long.
  The fields have the following meanings [I've added an example here
  in the explanation section from a more recent Large HDD to help in
  understanding this; don't worry about having to remember all this
  though, many programs exist which will interpret these bytes for
  you and display the data as total sector numbers in decimal]:


  For the following explanations, we'll use this data directly from a
  more recent drive (this partition is 268,430,022 sectors in length;
  137,436,171,264 bytes, or roughly: 137 GB).  The offsets shown here
  are only a convenient way to refer to the data bytes; to see where
  they are actually located in the MBR, you would have to add them to
  01BE, for example, if this were the Partition Table's first entry.

  Offsets:     0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  A  B  C  D  E  F

     Data:    80 01 01 00 07 FE FF FF 3F 00 00 00 C6 EA FF 0F


   Offset (from
   start of each
   entry; 0 - F)                     Meaning
   ------------      --------------------------------------------

         0 h          80h = Bootable (Active Partition)
                      00h = Non-bootable

                      [So, this is _the_ bootable partition.]
         --------------------------------------------------------

         1 h          Starting Head (1 byte; 0h to FEh, for 255)
                      -------- ====

                      [So, this partition's Starting Head is: 1 ]                       
         --------------------------------------------------------

         2 h          Starting Sector; only bits 0 thru 5; sector
                      numbers always start with 1, so this gives
                      us a max total of 63 sectors (01h to 3Fh).
                           ------------ ==========

                      Example: FA = 1111 1010, but only the first
                      5 bits are used... xx11 1010 = 3Ah or 58.

                     (Bits 6 and 7 are used as Bits 8 and 9 of
                      the 10-bit Starting Cylinder; see next.)

                      [So, our Starting Sector is also a: 1 ]
         --------------------------------------------------------

         3 h          Starting Cylinder; lower 8 bits (0 to 7)
                      of this byte, plus bits 6 and 7 from the
                      byte above to form a 10-bit number.
                      (Example: Use FAh from above and a 32h as
                       this byte.)

                      The number is formed from bits 6 and 7 of
                      the Starting Sector being placed in front
                      of these eight bits:

                        1   1       0  0  1  1  0  0  1  0
                      Bit9 Bit8   Bit7     through      Bit0

                      10 bit Hex number = 332h or Cylinder# 818.

                      [So, our Starting Cylinder is just: 0 ]
         --------------------------------------------------------

         4 h          System ID byte:

                        00 = Unused, Unknown.
			01 = DOS, 12-bit FAT.
			02,03 = XENIX.
			04 = DOS, 16-bit FAT.
			05 = DOS, Extended (16-bit FAT).
			06 = "BIGDOS" 
			07 = NTFS (Win nt/2k/xp), or HPFS (OS/2).
			0B = DOS, 32-bit FAT.
                        0C = 32-bit FAT using LBA (often means
                             that some or all of the partition
                             is beyond 8.4 GB into the drive).
                        0F = An LBA Extended Partition!
			63 = UNIX.
                        83 = Linux.

                          MBR_TABL.TXT in this distribution.)
         --------------------------------------------------------

         5 h          ENDING Head (1 byte; 0h to FEh, for 255)
                             ====
                      [NOTE: Although it's possible to count up
                       to 256 heads in one Hex byte, due to an
                       error made by Microsoft, the industry has
                       never used more than 255 heads!
        "All versions of MS-DOS (including MS-DOS 7 [Windows 95])
         have a bug which prevents booting on hard disks with 256
         heads (FFh), so many modern BIOSes provide mappings with
         at most 255 (FEh) heads."

                      [So, our partition Ending Head is:  255
                       It's almost ALWAYS this value for
                       all modern large hard drives! ]
         --------------------------------------------------------

         6 h          ENDing Sector; only bits 0 thru 5 are used
                      for a max total of 63 sectors (01h to 3Fh)
                            ------------ ==========

                    In our example: FF = 1111 1111, but only the
                    first 5 bits are used... xx11 1111 = 3Fh or
                    63.  (Bits 6 and 7 are used as Bits 8 and 9
                    of the 10-bit  ENDing  Cylinder; see next.)

                     [So, this partition's Ending Sector is:  63
                      It's almost ALWAYS this value. ]
         --------------------------------------------------------

	 7 h          Ending Cylinder; lower 8 bits (0 to 7) of
                      this byte, plus bits 6 and 7 from the byte
                      above to form a 10-bit number. (Example:
                      Use FFh from above and a 93h as this byte.)

                      The number is formed from bits 6 and 7 of
                      the Starting Sector being placed in front
                      of these eight bits:

                        1   1       1  0  0  1  0  0  1  1
                      Bit9 Bit8   Bit7     through      Bit0

                      10 bit Hex number = 393h or Cylinder# 915.
 
                    [ For our Example Partition, the 10-bit Hex
                      value is: 3FFh or 1023 in decimal. For ANY
                      partition that ends up somewhere beyond ~
                      8.4 GB into a modern large hard drive, the
                      "Ending Cylinder" can never be any greater
                      than 3FFh for a total of 1024 cylinders.

                      This shows you why CHS values are pointless
                      for all modern large hard drives! And their
                      translations (by the BIOS and the OS, etc.)
                      are performed using only the LBA values. ]
         --------------------------------------------------------

         8-B h      First Partition Sector (DoubleWORD: 4 bytes)

                      You must remember in the case of a DOUBLE
                    WORD to begin at the Fourth BYTE from where
                    the number is stored in memory and then work
                    backwards! In other words, REVERSE the order
                    in which all 4 bytes are stored if you want
                    to actually figure out the decimal equivalent
                    of the HEX DOUBLE WORD number.

                      For our Example Partition, this gives us a
                    Hex number of: 0000003Fh for 63 sectors.

         --------------------------------------------------------

         C-F h      Number of Sectors in Partiton (Double WORD)
                    "C6 EA FF 0F" must be reversed as:

                    0FFFEAC6h = 268,430,022 sectors or multiply
                    512 bytes per sector to give us a single
                    partition size of: 137,436,171,264 bytes, or
                    roughly about 137 GB.
         --------------------------------------------------------

                           =======================

       From our study above, you can now see why some disk editors
    display the CHS values as Head, Sector, Cylinder (HSC) instead:
    It's because that's roughly the order they appear in the Table.

    80  => The bootable partition (there can only be one; or none!).

    01 01 00  =>  Starting CHS of:  0, 1, 1  (The first cylinder).

    07  =>  The Partition Type is NTFS, (or possibly HPFS).

    FE FF FF  =>  Ending CHS of:  1023, 255, 63  (very standard now
                                  for almost all large hard drives!)

    3F 00 00 00  =>  Where the Partition begins, Absolute Sector 63.

    C6 EA FF 0F  =>  Total Number of Sectors in the Partition is:
                     268,430,022 sectors or 137,436,171,264 bytes.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

                             Another Example
                           ===================

            Here's the 16-bit record from the Partition Table
             that was included in our MBR_DEMO.BIN file:


             80 01 01 00 0B 7F BF FD 3F 00 00 00 C1 40 5E 00 
             -- -------- == -------- ----------- -----------

       80 => Bootable partition.

       01 01 00 => Starting at Head 1,
                   (Head 0 being the first head on the drive.)

                   Sector 1  ( 01h = 0000 0001 binary )
           [ (Use only lower 6 bits):  00 0001 = Sector 1 ]

                   Cylinder 0  (Use bits 6 and 7 (00) from 01h
           above to form the highest two bits of a 10-bit number)
           [ 00 0000 0000 = 000h = Cylinder 0  ]


       0B => 32-bit FAT (System ID; see table above for meanings)
       ==

       7F BF FD => Ending at Head 127 (7Fh),

                  Sector 63 ( BFh = 1011 1111 binary )
           [ (Use only lower 6 bits): 11 1111 = 3Fh = 63 ]

                  Cylinder 765 (Use bits 6 and 7 (10) from BFh
           above to form the highest two bits of a 10-bit number)
           [ 10 1111 1101 = 2FDh = Cylinder 765 ]


       3F 00 00 00 => First Sector of this Partition is 63.
                      Double-WORD converts to: 0000003Fh or 63.

       C1 40 5E 00 => And there are 6,176,961 sectors within this
                      Partition.
                     [ DoubleWORD equals: 005E40C1h = 6,176,961 ]
