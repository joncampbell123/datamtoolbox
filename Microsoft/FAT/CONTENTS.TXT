Filesystem Name:         MS-DOS FAT (File Allocation Table) filesystem
Filesystem abbreviation: FAT (FAT12, FAT16, FAT32)
Filesystem status:       Widely used on all MS-DOS/Windows media

FAT is the filesystem used by MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows to organize files.
Several versions exists, the first being FAT12 for drives less than 32MB,
then FAT16 for drives less than 2GB, and FAT32 for the rest. The FATn
number refers to the number of bits per entry in the file allocation table.

Files are stored in a very simple manner. They are given a starting cluster.
To find the next cluster, the program reads the corresponding entry in the
FAT to find it. The number read is the number of the next cluster for the
next piece.
