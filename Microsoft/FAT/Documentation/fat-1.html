<h2><a name="s1">1. FAT</a></h2>

<p>The traditional DOS filesystem types are FAT12 and FAT16.
Here FAT stands for File Allocation Table: the disk is divided
into <i>clusters</i>, the unit used by the file allocation,
and the FAT describes which clusters are used by which files.
</p><p>Let us describe the FAT filesystem in some detail.
The FAT12/16 type is important, not only because of
the traditional use, but also because it is useful for
data exchange between different operating systems, and
because it is the filesystem type used by all kinds of devices,
like digital cameras.

<p>First the boot sector (at relative address 0),
and possibly other stuff. Together these are the Reserved Sectors.
Usually the boot sector is the only reserved sector.
</p><p>Then the FATs (following the reserved sectors; the number of
reserved sectors is given in the boot sector, bytes 14-15;
the length of a sector is found in the boot sector, bytes 11-12).
</p><p>Then the Root Directory (following the FATs; the number of FATs
is given in the boot sector, byte 16; each FAT has a number
of sectors given in the boot sector, bytes 22-23).
</p><p>Finally the Data Area (following the root directory; the number
of root directory entries is given in the boot sector, bytes 17-18,
and each directory entry takes 32 bytes; space is rounded up to
entire sectors).
</p><p>
</p><h2><a name="ss1.2">1.2 Boot sector</a>
</h2>

<p>The first sector (512 bytes) of a FAT filesystem is the <i>boot sector</i>.
In Unix-like terminology this would be called the superblock. It contains
some general information.
</p><p>First an explicit example (of the boot sector of a DRDOS boot floppy).

(with FAT12 below 16 MB, FAT16 above):

Usually people have file systems with average file size
a few KB. With a cluster size of 64 KiB or more the amount
of slack (wasted space) can easily become more than half
the total space. FAT32 allows larger file systems
with a small cluster size:

The old 2-byte fields "total number of sectors" and
"number of sectors per FAT" are now zero; this information
is now found in the new 4-byte fields.
<p>An important improvement is the "First cluster of root directory"
field. Earlier, the root directory was not part of the Data Area,
and was in a known place with a known size, and hence was unable to grow.
Now the root directory is just somewhere in the Data Area.

</p><p>
</p><h2><a name="ss1.3">1.3 The File Allocation Table</a>
</h2>

<p>The disk is divided into clusters. The number of sectors per cluster
is given in the boot sector byte 13.
</p><p>The File Allocation Table has one entry per cluster.
This entry uses 12, 16 or 28 bits for FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32.
</p><p>
</p><h2><a name="ss1.3.1">1.3.1 The first two FAT entries</a>
</h2>

<p>The first cluster of the data area is cluster #2.
That leaves the first two entries of the FAT unused.
In the first byte of the first entry a copy of the media descriptor is stored.
The remaining bits of this entry are 1.
In the second entry the end-of-file marker is stored.
The high order two bits of the second entry are sometimes,
in the case of FAT16 and FAT32, used for dirty volume management:
high order bit 1: last shutdown was clean;
next highest bit 1: during the previous mount no disk
I/O errors were detected.
</p><p>(Historically this description has things backwards: DOS 1.0 did not have
a BIOS Parameter Block, and the distinction between single-sided and
double-sided 5.25" 360K floppies was indicated by the first byte in
the FAT. DOS 2.0 introduced the BPB with media descriptor byte.)
</p><p>
</p><h2><a name="ss1.3.2">1.3.2 FAT12</a>
</h2>

<p>Since 12 bits is not an integral number of bytes, we have to specify
how these are arranged. Two FAT12 entries are stored into three bytes;
if these bytes are uv,wx,yz then the entries are xuv and yzw.
</p><p>Possible values for a FAT12 entry are:
000: free,
002-fef: cluster in use; the value given is the
number of the next cluster in the file,
ff0-ff6: reserved,
ff7: bad cluster,
ff8-fff: cluster in use, the last one in this file.
Since the first cluster in the data area is numbered 2,
the value 001 does not occur.
</p><p>DOS 1.0 and 2.0 used FAT12. The maximum possible size of a FAT12
filesystem (volume) was 8 MB (4086 clusters of at most 4 sectors each).
</p><p>
</p><h2><a name="ss1.3.3">1.3.3 FAT16</a>
</h2>

<p>DOS 3.0 introduced FAT16. Everything very much like FAT12,
only the FAT entries are now 16 bit. Possible values for FAT16 are:
0000: free, 0002-ffef: cluster in use; the value given is the
number of the next cluster in the file, fff0-fff6: reserved,
fff7: bad cluster, fff8-ffff: cluster in use, the last one in this file.
</p><p>Now the maximum volume size was 32 MB, mostly since DOS 3.0 used
16-bit sector numbers. This was fixed in DOS 4.0 that uses
32-bit sector numbers. Now the maximum possible size of a
FAT16 volume is 2 GB (65526 clusters of at most 64 sectors each).
</p><p>
</p><h2><a name="ss1.3.4">1.3.4 FAT32</a>
</h2>

<p>FAT32 was introduced in Windows 95 OSR 2. It is not supported by Windows NT.
Everything very much like FAT16, only the FAT entries are now 32 bits
of which the top 4 bits are reserved. The bottom 28 bits have meanings
similar to those for FAT12, FAT16.
For FAT32:
Cluster size used: 4096-32768 bytes.
</p><p>Microsoft operating systems use the following rule to distinguish
between FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32. First, compute the number of clusters
in the data area (by taking the total number of sectors, subtracting
the space for reserved sectors, FATs and root directory, and dividing,
rounding down, by the number of sectors in a cluster).
If the result is less that 4085 we have FAT12. Otherwise, if it is
less than 65525 we have FAT16. Otherwise FAT32.
</p><p>Microsoft operating systems use fff, ffff, xfffffff as end-of-clusterchain
markers, but various common utilities may use different values.
Linux has always used ff8, fff8, but it now appears that some
MP3 players fail to work unless fff etc. is used. Since 2.5.40
this is also what Linux uses.

</p><h2><a name="ss1.4.1">1.4.1 VFAT</a>
</h2>

<p>In Windows 95 a variation was introduced: VFAT.
VFAT (Virtual FAT) is FAT together with long filenames (LFN),
that can be up to 255 bytes long. The implementation is an
ugly hack. These long filenames are stored in special directory entries.
A special entry looks like this:
</p><pre>Bytes   Content
0       Bits 0-4: sequence number; bit 6: final part of name
1-10    Unicode characters 1-5
11      Attribute: 0xf
12      Type: 0
13      Checksum of short name
14-25   Unicode characters 6-11
26-27   Starting cluster: 0
28-31   Unicode characters 12-13
</pre>

These special entries should not confuse old programs, since they
get the 0xf (read only / hidden / system / volume label) attribute
combination that should make sure that all old programs will ignore them.
<p>The long name is stored in the special entries, starting with the tail end.
The Unicode characters are of course stored little endian.
The sequence numbers are ascending, starting with 1.
</p><p>Now an ordinary directory entry follows these special entries,
and it has the usual info (file size, starting cluster, etc.),
and a short version of the long name.
Also the unused space in directory entries is used now:
bytes 13-17: creation date and time (byte 13: centiseconds 0-199,
bytes 14-15: time as above, bytes 16-17: date as above),
bytes 18-19: date of last access.
(And byte 12 is reserved for Windows NT - it indicates whether
the filename is in upper or in lower case; bytes 20-21 are reserved
for OS/2: it stores there the index in EA DATA.SF, the file containing
the extended attributes of all files. CYGWIN also uses a file EA DATA.SF.)
</p><p>Old programs might change directories in ways that can separate
the special entries from the ordinary one. To guard against that
the special entries have in byte 13 a checksum of the short name:
</p><pre>int i; unsigned char sum = 0;

    for (i = 0; i &lt; 11; i++) {
        sum = (sum &gt;&gt; 1) + ((sum &amp; 1) &lt;&lt; 7);  /* rotate */
        sum += name[i];                       /* add next name byte */
    }
</pre>

An additional check is given by the sequence number field.
It numbers the special entries belonging to a single LFN 1, 2, ...
where the last entry has bit 6 set.
<p>The short name is derived from the long name as follows:
The extension is the extension of the long name, truncated to length
at most three. The first six bytes of the short name equal the first
six nonspace bytes of the long name, but bytes +,;=[], that are not allowed
under DOS, are replaced by underscore. Lower case is converted to
upper case. The final two (or more, up to seven, if necessary)
bytes become ~1, or, if that exists already, ~2, etc.,
up to ~999999.
