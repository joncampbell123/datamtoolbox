  hard disk, <b><i>and</i></b> after obtaining a new computer or just a larger 
  drive (and copying data to it) <font color="blue"><b>wants to sell or give away

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">For <b>executives concerned 
  about company secrets on a large number of disks in old computers that must 
  be sold</b> for their remaining assets, <font color="#ff0000">your company's <b>IT Dept.</b> should have a recommended security 
  procedure</font> ( most likely using a costly security program to wipe the disks 
  ). <b>But, I still believe that simply 'zeroing-out' the drives is more than 
  adequate.</b> For example, say a competitor was able to buy every one of your 
  old machines (and assuming, of course, that your IT Dept. employees followed 
  the proper procedures for doing at least a one-pass 'wipe' of each drive!), 
  without knowing which drive contained any valuable data (or even if any of them 
  ever did), I doubt that they could justify the TIME and COST to employ an experienced 
  Electron Microscope operator in a Data Lab to hunt down bit by bit whatever 
  little info they MIGHT find with no assurances at all that ANYTHING ( let alone 
  something of value ) could ever be recovered!<br>
  <br>
  If you need to know how <b>to delete data from a computer used in a Military, 
  Government or Defense contractor's office, there are proscribed procedures for 
  doing so!</b> Personally, from the information I have read about such procedures, 
  I consider them to be ridiculous in their extreme measures; hostile forces will 
  always look for the 'weakest link' in obtaining desired information, and I think 
  it's still easier and quicker to obtain it from other sources than adequately 
  overwritten hard disks. Quite frankly, I believe that all Departments of the 
  US GOVernment have orders that any media containing info classified as TOP SECRET, 
  <b>must be PHYSICALLY DESTROYED</b>, so there's no issue about erasure here 
  at all!<br>
  <br>
  If you're a Billionaire (that keeps very sensitive data on hard disks), I doubt 
  that you'd ever NEED to resell your hard disks. You will, of course, have many 
  backup disks full of your data, but most likely you'd <b>use them until they 
  'died,' then have a TRUSTED and knowledgeable employee DESTROY those disks</b> 
  as you certainly would any floppy disk that failed.</font><br>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="5">Another site states: "Use 
  Delpart to 'wipe clean' a hard drive." This seems clear enough, right? 
  <b><font color="red">WRONG!</font></b> The ONLY thing that <a href="http://www.geocities.com/thestarman3/tool/dl/delpart.zip">DELPart</a> 
  does is to remove a maximum of just 64 <b>bytes</b> of information from each 
  hard disk's Partition Table in the Master Boot Record and possibly in each Extended 
  MBR. Well...<br>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If 
  you gave me a drive that only </font><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Delpart</font></b>

  could recover all of your computer's data using a single software tool !</i></b></font><br>
  <br>
  Even a company such as Power Quest in their <b><i>old</i></b> Partition Magic 
  4.0 program, made use of phrases such as: <font face="Courier New" size="4">" 
  <b>WARNING: </b> Deleting a partition will <b><font color="#990000">DESTROY</font></b> 
  any existing data"</font> or even this one: <font face="Courier New" size="4">"The 
  DELETE operation deletes a partition <b>and <font color="#990000">destroys all 
  its data</font></b>"</font>; which certainly seems to imply that it does 
  more than just remove partition information from the drive! But, once again, 
  these were nothing more than poorly worded statements <b> <i>trying to stress</i></b> 
  that the <i>average home user</i> would most likely not have been able to fix 
  such a mistake, <i>whereas</i>, a person who is familiar with data recovery 
  techniques could very easily do so!<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what programs can you use to do this?! The best type of 
  program (and <i>often</i> FREE) for what's called a SINGLE PASS ZERO-OUT is 
  the same one that many drive manufacturers ask you to run before allowing you 
  to return a drive under warranty! For example, <b>Western Digital®</b>'s 
  new <img src="WIPE_files/offsite.gif" height="11" width="33"> <a href="http://support.wdc.com/download/" target="WD"><b>DLG 
  DIAG</b></a> (included with their <i>Data Lifeguard Tools</i> packages or available 
  separately) will easily <i>zero-fill</i> every byte on a WD drive; just run 
  dlgdiag.exe and choose &#8220;Write Zeros to the drive.&#8221; I've also used 
  a similar program from <img src="WIPE_files/offsite.gif" height="11" width="33"> 
  <b><a href="http://www.maxtor.com/en/support/downloads/powermax.htm">Maxtor®</a></b> 
  on one of their drives. You must obtain this type of program from the manufacturer 
  of your particular drive, since they're made to work with <b><i>only</i></b> 
  on their own drives<a name="HGT">!</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, 
  most of them will still give you some valuable info about other manufacturer's 
  drives: For example, there's a nice DOS utility <i><b>that will identify the 
  Model, S/N and drive capacity of any </b></i><b>HDD</b><i><b> it finds on your 
  system. </b></i> It's from <b>Hitachi</b> (<font size="4"><b>Global Storage 
  Technologies</b></font>) and it's called: "<b>D</b>rive <b>F</b>itness 
  <b>T</b>est (<b>DFT</b>)" <img src="WIPE_files/offsite.gif" height="11" width="33"> 
  <a href="http://www.hgst.com/hdd/support/download.htm" target="hgt"><font size="4">http://www.hgst.com/hdd/support/download.htm</font></a> 
  . It's made for <b>IBM®</b> and Hitachi drives, so will <b>zero-out</b> 
  bytes from its &#8220;<b><font color="#ff0000">U</font></b>tilities&#8221; menu 
  for those drives only! If you know how to make a floppy disk from just an <b><i>image</i></b> 
  file (such as <a href="http://www.winimage.com/"><i>WinImage</i></a> or by using 
  the Linux '<b>dd</b>' program), then all you need is the 1440 kb <a href="http://www.hgst.com/downloads/dft-v360img.bin">dft-v360img.bin</a> 
  file. Otherwise, get the Windows floppy disk creator version (<a href="http://www.hgst.com/downloads/dft32_v360.exe">dft32_v360.exe</a>) 
  that will make its own boot/DFT floppy disk.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="5">There's a nice collection 
  of links to many Drive Manufacturing sites with some type of drive utility program 
  here: <img src="WIPE_files/offsite.gif" height="11" width="33"> <a href="http://tacktech.com/display.cfm?ttid=287">http://tacktech.com/display.cfm?ttid=287</a><a name="WIPE8">.</a></font></p>

<p><font size="5"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font size="6">If</font> your drive has 
  a capacity <i>under</i> about 8.4 GB, you can use a program I compiled and tested 
  on my own 6.4 GB drive: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/thestarman3/asm/mbr/WIPE8.zip">WIPE8.zip</a>. It does <b><i>not</i></b> 
  have the ability to easily test the bytes on your drive though; manufacturer's 
  programs use special software functions that the drive responds to directly, 
  whereas <b>WIPE8</b> (and <a name="DBAN"></a>other <i><b>simple</b> wiping</i> 
  tools) only use INT 13 <i>calls</i> to software routines in the BIOS code.</font></p>

<p><font size="5"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font size="6">However, </font> I've recently 
  found a FREE program with open source code at the SourceForge site called <img src="WIPE_files/offsite.gif" height="11" width="33"> 
  <a href="http://dban.sourceforge.net/" target="dban"></a> <a href="http://dban.sourceforge.net/" target="dban">Darik's 
  Boot and Nuke</a> (<a href="http://dban.sourceforge.net/" target="dban"><b>dban</b></a>) 
  which is a <i>self-contained</i> 1440 KiB boot disk that will <b> <i>wipe any 
  drive! It has many options too; </i></b> the simplest way to use it is to boot 
  up with the disk, press the ENTER key at the "<b>Boot:</b> prompt" 
  and then use its Interactive Menu. But you must exercise <b><i><font color="#ff0000"> 
  caution</font></i></b> with this disk: It's easy to set it up to <i>automatically</i> 
  <b>wipe <i>every drive</i> on your computer!</b> This is the same exact program 
  that's now <i>bundled</i> with Eraser, since that program was never designed 
  to do drive wiping. At the bottom of the <b>dban</b> web page, you'll find links 
  to a list of "Similar Products" (all commerical). DBAN also creates 
  and saves an interesting logfile of its operations at the end of a run<a name="LLF">.</a></font></p>

  reasons (apart from security) for initializing (zero-filling) every byte on 
  a drive: <br>
  <br>
  <b>1)</b> When you first obtain a hard disk, you may wish to <b>test</b> every 
  byte on the drive using a &#8220;<b><i>zero-out</i> and <i>test</i></b>&#8221; 
  program from the drive's manufacturer. <br>
  <br>
  <b>2)</b> Whenever you decide to "start all over again" and reformat 
  a drive, it's a very good idea to make sure there are no <i>left over</i> partition 
  <i>data structures</i> (EMBRs) just in case you need to run a data recovery 
  program at some time in the future. <b>If </b>you have <b><i>never</i></b> had 
  any Extended Partitions on the drive, you can forget about doing this. The problems 
  for recovery occur when there are Extended MBR sectors <b><i>and</i></b> Boot 
  Records that were never deleted (<i>zeroed-out</i>) before a new Extended partition 
  (with one or more <b><i>logical</i></b> drives) was created. Then if you try 
  to get your data back after accidentally deleting a partition or the MBR, you 
  (or a recovery program) will have a difficult time figuring out which EMBR sectors 
  are correct! </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="5">By 'zeroing-out' 
  a disk that has had many Extended partitions created on it, you ensure that 
  data recovery programs will see ONLY the correct size of the partitions you 
  are about to create.</font><font size="5"><br>

  Recovery experts seem to have a different opinion than those working in, let's 
  call it <i>theoretical research</i>, of what constitutes an 'adequate overwriting' 
  of a hard disk to keep any previous data from ever being recovered. If you have 
  the time and money to purchase and use a guaranteed secure wiping program, then 
  go ahead and do so; especially if you plan on reselling MANY lots of HDDs with 
  very valuable data on them. <b>However,</b> <i>for most individuals</i>, <b>I 
  don't see any reason at all to use more than a single pass overwrite as explained 
  on this page</b>. <br>
  <br>
  If you want to read about the details regarding Data Erasure and Security, you 
  could start with the <b>old</b> and "oft quoted" reference to Peter 
  Gutmann's paper. This is a somewhat technical paper, but it also appears to 
  me to have been too theoretical and now rather 'out-of-date' as far as a viable 
  threat to your security. For example, the TPI (tracks per inch) value that he 
  called "state of the art" for a disk's track density is at least 10 
  (or more) times LESS than what is actually being used today. Ref.: <a href="http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/%7Epgut001/pubs/secure_del.html" target="PG"> Secure 
  Deletion of Data from Magnetic and Solid-State Memory</a> - Read at least sections 
  <b>1 thru 3</b> and <b>conclusion</b>. <b>NOTE:</b> Prof. Gutmann added an <b>Epilogue</b> 
  to his original paper (some time later) in which he commented that people treated 
  his research <b>&#8220;</b>more as a kind of voodoo incantation to banish evil 
  spirits than the result of a technical analysis of drive encoding techniques.<b>&#8221;</b> 
  ( Please <a href="http://www.geocities.com/thestarman3/asm/mbr/GutmannEpilogue.txt">read his comments in full here</a>. I 
  think he probably shakes his head a bit every time he sees the phrase 'the Gutmann 
  method,' since most people never applied his work correctly. ) In a reply to 
  an e-mail I sent Prof. Gutmann about the advances in hard disk technology, he 
  stated: </font></p>
<font face="Arial" size="4">
<blockquote> <b>&#8220;</b> Not much has changed except that the older, easier-to-read 
  formats are mostly dead and everyone is now using Extended PRML which is even 
  harder to recover data from than PRML, as well as using smaller dimensions and 
  assorted exotic new technologies, so the problem is slowly fixing itself. <b>&#8221;</b><br>
  <font size="3"> [ <b>Feb</b>ruary 01, <b>2002</b>; quoted with Prof. Gutmann's 
  permission. ]</font> </blockquote>
</font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="4">I take this to mean that even Prof. Gutmann was 
  reluctantly stating the obvious about modern high density hard disks: You really 
  don't need to worry about anyone trying to use electron microscopy to find data 
  from a hard disk you discard today! <b><i>However</i></b>, if you're the kind 
  of person who <i>cherishes their paranoia(!),</i> then you can still find programs 
  on the Net such as: <img src="WIPE_files/offsite.gif" height="11" width="33"> 
  <a href="http://www.heidi.ie/eraser/" target="STE">Sami Tolvanen's Eraser</a> which 
  will overwrite files up to 35 full passes! Maybe if you especially hate a particular 
  file this could give you some sort of satisfaction too? <u>But, in order to 
  completely overwrite a whole drive (Sami's program will <b>not</b> 'clean out' 
  your Virtual Memory Swap Files!), you need to use the "dban" diskette 
  that now comes with it</u>! Eraser is mainly for eliminating certain files; 
  not for 'wiping' the whole disk. Since traces of what's been in a file (if not 
  the whole file) can often be found in download caches, SWAP files and other 
  cache locations as well, you need to make sure you know what you're doing; especially 
  if you're trying to erase an encrypted message full of company secrets! For 
  example: Did the 'plain text' of the message get left anywhere else on the drive? 
  Note: Perhaps you should <b>encrypt</b> all of your sensitive data on a disk 
  drive first, then 'wipe' the drive afterwards! Sounds like a good method to 
  me.<br>
  <br>
  Personally, I'm not at all concerned about anything I 'zero-out' on a hard disk 
  ever being seen by someone else again. If you think that any local law enforcement 
  or government agency is going to attempt to find data on a drive with ALL zeros 
  by taking a very long time and spending more money than they can really afford 
  with no assurance whatsoever of finding anything(!), then you're living in a 
  dream world that's already <i>beyond</i> all the <b>fictional</b> elements in 
  TV shows like <u><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="5">CSI</font></u> 
  and other such <i>scientific forensic evidence</i> dramas. It's much easier 
  for criminals, terrorists and government agencies to obtain data about you using 
  many other means!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="4">I remember one TV drama where a tech told a D.A. 
  that he couldn't find anything incriminating on a guy's HDD because he used 
  a 'scrubber' to clean out all of his cache files, etc. Then the tech added something 
  like: <b>&#8220;</b>If you gave me $50,000.00 to hire a lab with an electron 
  microscope and skilled technicians, maybe I could come up with a few more words 
  here or there in 6 months time.<b>&#8221;</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd say that's 
  a <i>fairly real</i> attitude of most organizations that have to deal with evidence 
  on HDDs. &nbsp;Do YOU as an average home user think you need to take even more 
  precautions than a criminal? &nbsp;&nbsp;Do YOU really need to worry about the 
  CIA or a foreign government being interested enough in YOUR hard drive to expend 
  all the necessary resources to find only a small amount of its contents!? <b><a name="FLOP"></a>Get 
  real</b>.<br>
  <br>
  <font size="5"><b><u>Floppy disks</u></b></font>, though, are something that 
  ALL the experts agree on:<br>
  <br>
  The data tracks are so wide and the drives so 'forgiving' that an overwritten 
  floppy could possibly be recovered using <i>only</i> a sophisticated software 
  program to adjust the placement of the heads and hunt for alternate data on 
  either side of the last overwrite. It takes so much TIME to adequately 'wipe' 
  a floppy (with MANY passes), that the easiest way to dispose of one with a number 
  of 'bad sectors' is to just crack it open and <b><i>shred into tiny pieces</i></b> 
  the flexible disk media that's inside ( it looks similar to the material used 
  for audio tape)!</font><br>
